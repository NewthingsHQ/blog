Hosting the 2025 Thailand Computer Festival has been an incredible journey for our team. From the initial planning stages to the final moments of the event, we faced challenges but also had the opportunity to learn and grow. Looking back, it’s clear that the event was a success, and much of that success was due to the hard work and collaboration of our staff.

The TCF was inspired by another contest called the WMC, which was a mathematics competition unlike no other. The WMC championship brought students together into groups and made us do activities together as teams. It was an experience that we wanted to recreate the magic of, which is why we created the TCF.

One of the most significant achievements of this year’s festival is that we were the first computer contest to be led by schoolchildren. As students ourselves, this was a huge milestone. We took on the roles of organizers, event planners, and even instructors, demonstrating the power of collaboration and leadership among peers. The experience showed that schoolchildren, when given the opportunity and responsibility, can manage and execute a large-scale event just as effectively as professionals.

One of the biggest improvements from our initial concerns was staffing. Although we had originally anticipated being understaffed, we managed to gather a great team to handle all aspects of the event. With plenty of members ready to respond to problems, we were able to divide the workload effectively and ensure that everything ran smoothly.

The "Digital Activity" zone turned out to be a crowd favorite. Instead of focusing solely on static displays, we introduced a dynamic environment where kids could compete against each other in a series of fun challenges. Watching the participants work together in teams and race to complete their tasks was a rewarding experience for both the staff and the students. The energy in the room was powerful, seeing how much the kids enjoyed the activities.

The workshops were another highlight. These sessions gave students the opportunity to learn new skills in areas like coding, digital design, and more. It was amazing to see their excitement as they absorbed new knowledge and put it into practice. We got support from instructors all across Thailand coming to help teach the small group of students. The workshops helped make the event educational and engaging, and we were thrilled with the level of participation.

The awards ceremony was a memorable conclusion to the day. The excitement of the winners, along with the proud smiles of their teammates and families, was a great reminder of why we do this. The positive feedback from participants made the awards ceremony feel like a true celebration of achievement.

Overall, the Thailand Computer Festival 2025 was a great success, and we couldn’t have done it without the support of our dedicated staff and volunteers. While there were challenges along the way, we adapted quickly and turned those challenges into opportunities. Instead of a competition simply being a place for students to come and take an exam, we transformed it into a place where students can also learn new things and make new friends. We made sure that 

As we look forward to next year, we’re already brainstorming ways to make the event even better, with more activities, workshops, and fun experiences for all involved. We want to thank all our competitors this year for the immense support and patience from you all. The success of TCF 2025 has inspired us to keep pushing forward, and we can’t wait to bring even more innovation and excitement to the next edition.
