So - what is Newthings?

Some of you might be wondering: What is Newthings? In this post, we'll be telling you all about Newthings, and how it came to be

Newthings was formed after the fall of our previous company, BirdOne. BirdOne collapsed from lack of motivation and work, along with members who are not good at doing what we do. We took note of that, and formed Newthings from those who actually have a passion for coding and creation of new things—hence the name.

In BirdOne, there was a team called OAFT - The Organization for the Advancement of Future Technologies, a company we had acquired mere months before. OAFT was a group that experimented in interesting things, with members who want to do what they do. We built Newthings based on OAFT — To continuously experiment with things everyone enjoys, and becoming a place for new projects.

Newthings is still in its early days, but it’s already far more than a replacement for BirdOne. Every app, every tool, every idea is part of a broader mission to build solutions that are limitless.

Here's to the future of Newthings!
